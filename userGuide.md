# Skool About Page Clone - User Guide

## Purpose

This is a 1:1 clone of the Skool community about page, designed as a landing page for Skool services. The page features an interactive video carousel, community information, and call-to-action elements matching the original design exactly.

## Access

Public - No login required

## Powered by Manus

This project showcases a modern web application built with cutting-edge technologies. The frontend leverages **React 19** with **TypeScript** for type safety and interactive state management. The user interface is crafted with **shadcn/ui** component library and **Tailwind CSS 4** for a fully customized light theme matching Skool's aesthetic. Icons are provided by **Heroicons** for a clean, professional look. Real media assets from the original page are integrated for authentic presentation. Deployment runs on auto-scaling infrastructure with global CDN for instant worldwide access.

## Using Your Website

The page presents a complete community landing experience with interactive elements. At the top, you will find a navigation bar with tabs for "Community," "Classroom," "Calendar," "Members," "Map," "Leaderboards," and "About" (active). The search bar in the center allows content exploration, while the purple "Log In" button provides account access.

The main content area features an **interactive video carousel**. Click any of the four thumbnail images below the main video player to switch between different videos. The active video is highlighted with a black border, while inactive thumbnails show gray borders. Hover over thumbnails to see the border darken, indicating they are clickable.

Community details display as badges showing "Public," "552 members," and "Free" status, along with creator information for "Andreas M." The description section highlights the value proposition with a bold headline about transforming your design practice.

You will find a detailed list under "What's Inside" covering AI-powered design agency insights, app showcases, tool guides, reviews, and design workflows. Additional benefits are marked with arrows, emphasizing daily engagement, motivated community, and a practical no-hype approach. The "Join FREE" link at the bottom provides quick access.

On the right sidebar, the community card displays the banner image, description, and three related links with external link icons. Stats show "552 Members," "7 Online," and "4 Admins" with colorful member avatars below. The prominent yellow "JOIN GROUP" button invites participation and darkens on hover.

## Managing Your Website

You can customize content, styling, and layout by editing component files in the Code panel. The Preview panel shows real-time updates as you make changes. To modify theme colors or typography, adjust CSS variables in the index.css file. Component-specific styling can be refined in individual files located in client/src/components.

For deployment, use the Publish button in the Management UI header after creating a checkpoint. The Dashboard panel provides analytics and visibility controls once your site is live. Settings allow you to configure website name, logo, and domain preferences.
