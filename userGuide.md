This project showcases a modern web application built with cutting-edge technologies. The frontend leverages **React 19** with **Next.js** for optimal performance and **TypeScript** for type safety. The user interface is crafted with **shadcn/ui** component library and **Tailwind CSS 4** for a fully customized dark theme. Icons are provided by **Heroicons** for a clean, professional aesthetic. Deployment runs on auto-scaling infrastructure with global CDN for instant worldwide access.

## Using Your Website

The page presents a complete community landing experience. At the top, you will find a navigation bar with tabs for "Community," "Classroom," "Calendar," "Members," "Map," "Leaderboards," and "About." The search bar in the center allows you to explore content, while the "Log In" button provides account access.

The main content area features a video player with a play button and playback information showing speed and duration. Below the video, you will see thumbnail previews of additional content. Community details display as badges showing "Public," member count, and "Free" status, along with the creator information.

The description section highlights the value proposition with a bold headline about transforming your design practice. You will find a detailed list under "What's Inside" covering topics like AI-powered design agency insights, app showcases, tool guides, and design workflows. Additional benefits are marked with arrows, emphasizing daily engagement and a practical, no-hype approach.

On the right sidebar, the community card displays stats for members, online users, and admins. Member avatars appear as colorful circles, and the prominent "JOIN GROUP" button invites you to participate. Related links provide quick access to additional resources.

## Managing Your Website

You can customize content, styling, and layout by editing the component files in the Code panel. The Preview panel shows real-time updates as you make changes. To modify the dark theme colors or typography, adjust the CSS variables in the index.css file. Component-specific styling can be refined in individual component files located in the client/src/components directory.

For deployment, use the Publish button in the Management UI header after creating a checkpoint. The Dashboard panel provides analytics and visibility controls once your site is live. Settings allow you to configure the website name, logo, and domain preferences.
